# stock-purchase-profit-or-loss
This app takes user's stock price for one stock when he bought it as first input and the quantity of stocks as the second input and take today's stock price for that stock as the third input. As a result it tells the user how much profit or loss he/she is making with percentage and absolute value of profit or loss.

The app is calculating profit or loss by using simple mathematical formulas:

profit = (current - initial)*quantity if current is greater than initial;
loss = (initial - current)*quantity if initial is greater than current;

profit % = (profit/(initial*quantity))*100;
loss % = (loss/(initial*quantity))*100;
